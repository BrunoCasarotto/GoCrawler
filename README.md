# GoCrawler

This is a personal project to grab all the infos from a pre determined wiki page (in this case, Nikke wiki page)

But ... why? Because a crawler is something that I wanted to do for so very long and was studying Go. That's it, thanks for listening to my TED Talk, also, I might try to use mermaidjs in future projects.

K, bye.
